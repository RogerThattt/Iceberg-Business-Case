# Iceberg-Business-Case

âœ… Problem (Before Iceberg):
Telecom operators generate massive amounts of data across BSS/OSS systems:

Call detail records (CDRs)

Network telemetry and alarms

Customer experience data (CRM, NPS, support logs)

Billing events

Usage patterns (4G/5G consumption, roaming)

These data sets:

Are siloed in multiple data lakes and warehouses (Hive, HDFS, RDBMS).

Need complex ETL jobs to reconcile and join.

Are hard to update (e.g., fix a bad record).

Struggle with late-arriving data.

Suffer from high storage and compute costs due to duplicate snapshots and rigid partitioning.
